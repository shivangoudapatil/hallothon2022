Calorie Burn Prediction Using XGBoost

In order to determine how many calories an individual would burn based on various attributes, 
this study is all about gathering the right data set to train our machine learning models.
Pre-processing of the records is necessary before the statistics feeding operation. After that, data processing is completed, 
and the data is arranged as plots and graphs using several visualization techniques. 
Here we use our own XG Boost regressor from scratch vs library module for making comparison and then evaluating these models
